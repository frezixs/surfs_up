# surfs_up
#### Description 
In this module we are going to analyze weather data in jupyter notebook and making an app. Using this app people can make decisions 
(such as opening a shop at certain place) based on the weather report. 

## Overview 
In this analysis we want to see temperature statistics for June and December to see what time in a year is suitable for running a surf shop 
We ran two queries one for June and one for December. Then we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our 
dataframe is created, we can get our summary statistics 

### Part 1: 
In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

### Part 2: 
In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0

Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 -- making a .5 difference in the two different seasons

## Summary 
From our data we can tell what our temperatures are but since there are other attributes to the weather such as precipitation it shows that we can run additional queries to let us know whether or not people can come and visit the shop. If we are able to gain more data for the area we can run even more queries! From there we can decide how we would like to build the shop and what areas would make this a more prominent location for visitors to come.
